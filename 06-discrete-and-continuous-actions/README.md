### 6. Discrete and Continuous Actions

#### 6.1 Continous action space

#### 6.2 Discretizition of action space

#### 6.3 Use of function approximation

#### 6.4 Searching for the policy

#### 6.5 Exercises

In this lesson we looked for the first time at the a problem in which the both the number of states and the number
of actions available to the agent are very large or continuous. We introduced a series of methods based on policy
search. So, for this lesson's Notebook we will look into a problem with continuous state and actions and we
will apply function approximation to come up with the best solution to it.
