### 7. Observable and Partially-Observable States

#### 7.1 Is what we see what it is?

#### 7.2 State Estimation

#### 7.3 Control in Partially-Observable Environments

#### 7.4 Exercises

In this lesson we learned that what we see is not always what it is happening in the world. Our perceptions might be
biased, we might not have a 20/20 vision and more importantly we might think we have 20/20 but we might not. For this
reason is important to know that there are other ways of estimating states. In the following Notebook we will look
at a very popular method for state estimation called the Kalman Filter for a very basic problem partially-observable
states problem.
