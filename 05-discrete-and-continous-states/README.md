#### 5.3 Use of function approximation

#### 5.4 Exercises

In this lesson we got a step closer to what we could call 'real-world' reinforcement learning. In specific,
we look at a kind of environment in which there are so many states that we can no longer represent a table
of all of them. Either because the state space is too large or flat out continuous.

In order to get a sense for this type of problem we will look a basic Cart Pole pole, and we will solve it by
discretizing the state space in a way to making a manual function approximation of this problem.
