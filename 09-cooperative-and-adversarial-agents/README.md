### 9. Cooperative and Adversarial Agents

#### 9.1 Agents with conflicting objectives

Going one step further, agents on an environment could actually have conflicting goals. Once we
starting taking into account multiple agents competing for the same objectives, the field of game
theory becomes important. Game Theory and reinforcement learning are the two fundamental fields
of multi-agent reinforcement learning. When agents have opposing goals, there is probably no clear
optimal solution and an equilibrium among the agents need to be search for. For this, lots of game
theory come to play.

#### 9.2 Teams of agents with conflicting objectives

Finally, we can think of worlds in which teams of agents compete against other teams for conflicting
objectives. The RoboCup soccer is a well known example of this type of environments. Make sure to check the
recommended readings below. We will work on a notebook with a simulation world like the RoboCup soccer
provided by OpenAI Gym.

#### 9.3 Exercises

In this lesson we looked into how things change when we interact with other agents, and these agents can be
cooperative, or adversarial or perhaps a combination of both if we think adversarial teams. For this lesson,
and to close up on the series of Notebooks well, we will look into the world of gym-soccer environments.
