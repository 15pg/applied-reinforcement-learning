### Steps to run Project 2 code

The entire code is contained in a single python file named `lunar_lander.py`

1. Clone the repository

    ```
    $ git clone https://...
    ```

2. Dependencies
  1. `gym` with the `box2d` environment
  2. `numpy`
  3. `scikit-learn` version 0.18  

3. Run the code

    ```
    $ python lunar_lander.py
    ```

4. A new directory `lunar_lander_results` will be created in your working 
directory and all the results will be available in it. Don't worry about the 
`plotting.py` file. It is needed only for postprocessing of results (for 
report generation). 

Thats it!
