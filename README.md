# Applied Reinforcement Learning

This repository will contain a series of lessons about Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making.

## Part I: Introduction

1. Introduction to Decision-Making:

Decision-making has captivated human intelligence for many years. Humans have always 
wondered what makes us the most intelligent animal in this planet. The fact is that 
decision-making could be seen as directly correlated with intelligence. The better
the decisions being made, either by a natural or artificial agent, the more likely we 
will perceive that agent as intelligent. Moreover, the level of impact decisions have
are directly or indirectly recognized by our societies. Roles in which decision-making
is a primary responsibility are the most highly regarded in today's workforce. If we
think of prestige and salary for example, leadership roles rate higher than management,
and management rate higher than the rest of the labor force.

Being such an important field, it comes at no surprise that decision-making is studied
under many different names. Economics, Neuroscience, Psychology, Operations Research,
Statistics, Optimal Control Theory, Reinforcement Learning are some of the prominent 
fields contributing to the understanding of decision-making. However, if we think a little
deeper most fields are concern with optimal decision-making. They might not necessarily
contribute directly to improving our understanding of how we take optimal decision, but
they too would benefit from learning this. For instance, think journalism. This activity
is not concerned with understanding how to take optimal decisions in general, but it is 
definitely interested in learning how to take optimal decisions in regards to preparing
news and writing for newspapers. Under this token, we can see how fields that study 
decision-making are a generalization of other fields.

In the following lessons we will explore decision-making in regards to Reinforcement 
Learning. As Reinforcement Learning is a descendant of Artificial Intelligence, we will 
briefly touch on Artificial Intelligence and also, being such a related field, Statistics.
We will have a lesson about decision-making when there is only one decision to make. This
is perhaps the major difference of Reinforcement Learning, which relaxes this constrain
and also studies problem in which agents can take multiple decision in a sequential manner. 
This sense of interaction with an environment sets Reinforcement Learning apart. We will
continue loosing constrains and presenting more abstract topics related to Reinforcement
Learning. We will explore deterministic and stochastic transitions, know and unknown
environments, discrete and continuous states, discrete and continuous actions, observable
and partially observable states, single and multiple agents, cooperative and adversarial
agents, and finally, we will put everything in the perspective of human intelligence.
