### 11. Conclusion

 Reinforcement Learning is such an exciting field. Some people would
 argue that this field is the true "artificial intelligence". This project
 should provide you with a good foundation for understanding reinforcement
 learning. We, not only gave our intuitive take on each of the concepts introduced,
 but also provided you with problems that you could do on your own to gain a 
 deeper, hands-on understanding of the concepts discussed. Also, we pointed at
 several paper to further your knowledge in each of the areas presented. 
 We really hope that this serves you well. Also, remember that if you want to
 help making this series better, everything from a typo, to another notebook, or 
 maybe an entire section, you are welcome to open a pull-request and I'll take 
 a look and accept it if it helps with this project's objective. To give an
 intuitive and hands-on perspective of reinforcement learning and decision-making.
